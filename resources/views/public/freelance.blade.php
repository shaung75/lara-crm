        <h2>A bit more detail&hellip;</h2>
        <p>I'm a web developer based in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, specialising in Wordpress and Drupal</p>
        <p>I have been building websites for the previous 20 years and 10 of those have been in a commercial environment. Before taking on the life of a freelancer in October 2018, the previous 5 years I was the sole employed devloper for the <a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org" title="The Wildlife Trusts">Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts</a>.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for usability, accessibility, web standards and getting the job done. Basically I’m a bit of a geek, so I love getting my teeth into anything that’s a problem!</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Becoming a director for <a href="http://www.landingnet.co.uk">LandingNet Ltd</a> – a Web Development and Online Marketing Agency – back in 2008 has increased my knowledgebase and skillset tremendously since taking up the role.</p>
        <p>Originally coming from an analytical background within Vodafone Business Solutions Ltd (formally Project Telecom Ltd), I saw the move to LandingNet as a way to forward my career and increase my own personal development into a direction more focused on the "geeky" online side of things.</p>
        <p>To skip over the history of LandingNet (you can <a href="http://www.landingnet.co.uk/other-stuff/meet-the-team/history.php">read it here</a> if you want), when we became independent from Totemic I was taken out of my comfort zone and had to develope a whole new range of skills in order to fulfill work for our clients.</p>
        <p>After leaving LandingNet in 2011 I then set up Big Square Box to focus more on my own personal projects, while still having a small customer base to do work for as and when required.</p>
        <p>In 2013 I saw a job opportunity being advertised for a web devloper for <a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org" title="The Wildlife Trusts">Wildlife Trusts</a> - this was something that I <em>had</em> to apply for as it would mean working for a national charity in a sector that I care deeply about. I was the lucky candidate and I enjoyed working there for 5 years looking after nearly 40 local Wildlife Trusts main websites, along with their smaller campaign sites.</p>
        <p>During my time at the Wildlife Trusts, I learned a great deal managing a suite of Drupal 6, Drupal 8 and Wordpress websites, and gave advice on one of their legacy Joomla websites. I was responsible for building their online Direct Debit membership platform (<a href="https://membership.wildlifetrusts.org/">https://membership.wildlifetrusts.org/</a>) which significantly increased member sign ups.</p>
        <p>In 2018 I decided to leave the Wildlife Trusts to better facilitate a work/life balance with my wife and children and went back to my roots of being a freelancer. Since making the move, I have helped a number of clients develop new functionality and I still work closely with LandingNet Ltd and the Wildlife Trusts.</p>
